# Conclusion

## Summary

In this project, we analyzed how remote work affects employees’ productivity, social well-being, and job satisfaction using the Remote Working Survey (2020), which includes 1,507 respondents. We investigated our four research questions using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis after cleaning the dataset and translating qualitative responses into numerical values. Our results show that the effect of remote work on productivity is highly heterogeneous. While many respondents reported no change, the productivity distribution displayed a slight negative skew (–0.13), meaning productivity gains were more common than losses. Productivity did not vary significantly by organisation size, and the correlation between remote-work percentage and productivity change was positive but weak (r = 0.14), suggesting that working remotely more often is associated with a small increase in perceived productivity. 

The clearest pattern we found was the improvement in work–life balance. Remote work nearly eliminated commuting time, and our comparison showed that personal and family time increased from 39.6% to 46% of the day on average when employees worked from home. This extra time probably improved mental health and could be responsible for the overall high desire for remote work. Indicators of collaboration and connection on the social side were centered around neutral responses, showing that employees' feeling of social connection was neither greatly improved nor harmed by distant work. Overall, our research indicates that working remotely can boost well-being and productivity, mainly through time savings and better daily time management, but its effects on social interaction seem to be less clear. These findings help us better understand how employees' lives are shaped by remote work and directly address the objectives of our project. 

## Limitations

Although our project provides meaningful insights, it also has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the dataset comes from a single region (New South Wales, Australia) and only reflects the year 2020, when remote work was still relatively new due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This context may not represent long-term or post-pandemic habits, which limits how generalizable our findings are to other geographic areas, industries, or years. The data also contained several extreme outliers (for example, two respondents aged 120), as well as categories with very small sample sizes such as “rather not say” for gender. We removed these categories to avoid inconsistent comparisons, but doing so slightly reduces the diversity of our sample. 

**Comparative Analysis of the Impact of COVID-19 (United States, India, France, Brazil, Australia)**

The comparative analysis highlights substantial disparities in the evolution and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across the five selected countries. The United States records the highest number of total cases, followed by India, France, and Brazil, whereas Australia clearly stands out with a significantly lower number of reported infections.
With respect to mortality, a similar pattern is observed. The United States and Brazil exhibit the highest death tolls among the sample, while France occupies an intermediate position. In contrast, Australia displays a markedly lower mortality level, indicating a comparatively limited health impact of the pandemic.
The analysis of active cases, defined as the number of individuals currently infected (total cases minus recoveries and deaths), reveals that active infections remained relatively high in the United States and Brazil at the time of data collection. 

Interpretation of the Australian Case

Based on our interpretation of the graphical results, Australia appears to have been relatively less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in terms of mortality and active infections. Several structural and geographical factors may help explain this outcome. First, Australia has a comparatively younger population, and younger age groups were statistically less exposed to severe forms of the disease. Furthermore, the country is characterized by a large territory combined with a low population density, which naturally limits close interpersonal contact and reduces the speed of viral transmission.
In addition, Australia’s geographical isolation likely delayed the initial introduction of the virus and facilitated the implementation of strict border control measures, which played a critical role during the early stages of the pandemic. Finally, early public health interventions and the overall efficiency of the healthcare system may also have contributed to limiting severe cases and fatalities.

:::

From a methodological standpoint, our study mostly uses correlation analysis and descriptive statistics, which help in finding patterns but cannot allow us to prove causation. For example, even if we discovered a slight positive correlation (r = 0.14) between the percentage of remote work and productivity change, this does not show that remote work raises productivity. These results could be impacted by additional unobserved factors including home environment, digital technologies, management assistance, or individual preferences. In addition, a number of important factors such as productivity, teamwork, and satisfaction are self-reported, which may create bias because workers may exaggerate or understate their experiences. 

## Future Work

- **Extend dataset:** "Include the 2021 wave of the Remote Working Survey and perform longitudinal comparisons to track changes over time."
- **Enhance analytical approach:** "Use advanced statistical models like multiple regression to identify key predictors of productivity and satisfaction."
- **Broaden contextual factors:** "Add variables on digital tools, communication habits, and mental health indicators for richer insights."
- **Integrate mixed data types:** "Combine quantitative survey data with qualitative responses to capture nuanced experiences of remote work in other regions not only Australia."
