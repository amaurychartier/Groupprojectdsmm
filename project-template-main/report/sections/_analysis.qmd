## Methods

**Remote Work Intensity and Productivity**

This section examines the relationship between remote work intensity and self-reported productivity change using both graphical analysis and linear regression models.

**Exploratory relationship**

Figure plots productivity change against the share of time spent working remotely, together with a fitted linear regression line. The slope of the line is positive, and the Pearson correlation coefficient is approximately 0.14, indicating a weak positive association between remote work intensity and productivity change. Individuals who work remotely more frequently tend, on average, to report slightly higher productivity. However, the magnitude of this association is limited and should not be interpreted as causal.

**Baseline regression model**

To formalise this relationship, productivity change is first modelled using a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with remote work intensity as the only explanatory variable:
$$
\text{Productivity}_i =
\beta_0
+ \beta_1 \,\text{RemoteShare}_i
+ \varepsilon_i
$$

```{python}
fig = px.scatter(
    df,
    x="Remote_pct_last_year",
    y="Productivity_remote_vs_workplace",
    trendline="ols",
    title="Remote Work % vs Productivity Change (Regression)"
)

fig.update_xaxes(title="Remote Work Percentage")
fig.update_yaxes(title="Productivity Change (%)")

fig.show()
```


This baseline model captures the raw relationship between remote work intensity and productivity without accounting for any additional individual or organisational characteristics.
The estimation results show that the coefficient on remote work intensity is positive and statistically significant. Moving from no remote work to full remote work is associated with an increase of approximately 11–12 percentage points in reported productivity. Despite this statistically significant effect, the explanatory power of the model remains very low, with an R-squared of around 0.02. This indicates that remote work intensity alone explains only a very small share of the variation in productivity changes across individuals.

**Productivity by remote work intensity groups**

To complement the continuous analysis, productivity changes are also examined by grouping individuals into remote work intensity categories (0–20%, 20–50%, 50–80%, and 80–100%). This binned representation allows for a clearer comparison of productivity distributions across levels of remote work.

The results show that median productivity gains increase once remote work exceeds 20% of working time and stabilise around +20% for medium to high levels of remote work intensity. Mean productivity changes follow a similar pattern, rising from approximately +10% in the lowest group to nearly +20% in the highest group.

However, the distributions overlap substantially across groups, with wide dispersion in all categories and both positive and negative productivity changes observed at every level of remote work intensity. This highlights considerable individual heterogeneity and reinforces the conclusion that remote work intensity alone is insufficient to explain productivity outcomes.

#  Data prep 
tmp = df[['Remote_pct_last_year','Productivity_remote_vs_workplace']].dropna().copy()

labels = ['0–20%', '20–50%', '50–80%', '80–100%']
tmp['remote_bin'] = pd.cut(
    tmp['Remote_pct_last_year'],
    bins=[-0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.01],
    labels=labels
)
tmp['remote_bin'] = pd.Categorical(tmp['remote_bin'], categories=labels, ordered=True)

# Summary table
stats = (tmp.groupby('remote_bin', observed=False)['Productivity_remote_vs_workplace']
         .agg(count='count', mean='mean', median='median')
         .reset_index())

stats['mean'] = stats['mean'].round(2)
stats['median'] = stats['median'].round(2)

#  Figure with subplot 
fig = make_subplots(
    rows=2, cols=1,
    row_heights=[0.75, 0.25],

    vertical_spacing=0.08)

# Boxplots (one trace per bin to force order)
colors = px.colors.qualitative.Set2

for i, label in enumerate(labels):
    fig.add_trace(
        go.Box(
            y=tmp.loc[tmp['remote_bin'] == label, 'Productivity_remote_vs_workplace'],
            name=label,
            marker_color=colors[i],

                stats['mean'],
                stats['median']
            ],

    yaxis_title="Productivity change (%)",
    xaxis_title="Remote work percentage (binned)")

fig.show()
```

**Extended regression model with controls**

The analysis is then extended by including additional explanatory variables that capture individual and organisational characteristics:

$$
\text{Productivity}_i =
\beta_0
+ \beta_1 \,\text{RemoteShare}_i
+ \beta_2 \,\text{Age}_i
+ \beta_3 \,\text{OrganisationSize}_i
+ \beta_4 \,\text{ManagingPosition}_i 
+ \beta_5 \,\text{OrgEncouragement}_i
+ \beta_6 \,\text{Collaboration}_i
+ \varepsilon_i
$$

These variables were selected based on exploratory analysis and correlation checks, as they showed meaningful associations with productivity change and are directly related to working conditions under remote work.
After including these controls, the coefficient on remote work intensity remains positive and statistically significant, although slightly smaller, at around 9.6. Importantly, the explanatory power of the model improves: the R-squared increases from approximately 0.02 in the baseline model to about 0.05 in the extended specification. This increase indicates that organisational context and collaboration quality account for an additional share of the variation in productivity changes.
Among the control variables, perceived collaboration quality when working remotely shows a strong positive association with productivity, while organisational encouragement of remote work is negatively associated. Age and managing position do not exhibit statistically significant effects once other factors are controlled for.

# Interpretation

Overall, the results convey a consistent message across graphical analysis and regression models. Remote work intensity is positively associated with productivity change, but the relationship is weak in magnitude and explains only a limited fraction of productivity differences. The increase in R-squared when adding organisational and collaboration-related variables confirms that productivity outcomes under remote work are influenced by multiple factors. While remote work intensity plays a role, individual heterogeneity and organisational conditions appear to be more important drivers of productivity changes.
