    "  This study explores how remote work affects productivity, social well-being, and job satisfaction. Using the 2020 NSW Remote Working Survey, we applied descriptive statistics and correlation analysis to quantify attitudes toward remote work. Findings show mixed productivity outcomes: most employees report gains up to 50%, fewer others declines. Collaboration indicators remain neutral, while reduced commuting significantly increases personal and family time, supporting better work–life balance. Most respondents prefer more remote work, suggesting higher satisfaction overall. Limitations include self-reported data and cross-sectional design. Results indicate organizations should maintain flexible work arrangements and support social engagement strategies.\n",

    "## Controlling Python (Code) Generated Figure Size\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Python matplotlib plots**, figure size is controlled **in your Python code** using `figsize`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Standard readable size\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))  # width, height in inches\n",
    "\n",
    "# Smaller figure\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 4))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Larger figure\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why `figsize` in code?** When you use `plt.subplots(figsize=...)` or `plt.figure(figsize=...)`, matplotlib creates the image at that exact size. Quarto chunk options like `#| fig-width:` and `#| fig-height:` are ignored because the figure size is already determined by your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To resize figures after creation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `width` attribute in curly braces (works for any image):\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "![My plot](path/to/plot.png){width=70%}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in the chunk options (only for formats without explicit `figsize`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#| fig-width: 7\n",
    "#| fig-height: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set `figsize` in your Python code to a readable default (e.g., `figsize=(8, 5)`)\n",
    "2. If the figure appears too large/small in your report, adjust the `figsize` values proportionally\n",
    "3. Keep aspect ratio consistent: divide/multiply both dimensions by the same factor\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good default sizes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small plot: `figsize=(6, 4)`\n",
    "- Standard plot: `figsize=(8, 5)`\n",
    "- Large plot: `figsize=(10, 6)`\n",
    "- Wide plot: `figsize=(10, 4)`\n",
    "- Square plot: `figsize=(6, 6)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip:** DPI (dots per inch) also affects quality. Matplotlib default is 100, but for publications use `plt.savefig('plot.png', dpi=300)` if you need high-resolution images.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective in this project is to understand how remote work, following the COVID-19 pandemic, has changed firms’ work practices. During this period, many companies had no choice but to adopt remote working practices, reshaping traditional work environments. The main goal is to analyze how working remotely influences people’s mental health, job satisfaction, and performance levels. Using accurate data from the Remote Working Survey (2020), we want to explore factors such as communication satisfaction, work-life balance, social connection, and productivity outcomes, in order to understand whether remote work affects employees positively or negatively. By converting survey responses into numerical values, we can quantify attitudes toward remote work and compare groups such as gender, age, or employment type.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we began working with the dataset, we refined our focus on the social and psychological dimensions of remote work. To make the analysis easier to interpret, we also transformed qualitative survey responses into numerical values. And, in addition, we removed categories with very small sample sizes to keep the dataset consistent and avoid unreliable comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "-   How does remote work influence employees’ overall productivity?\n",
    "-   How does remote working affect employees’ ability to maintain social connections and avoid feelings of isolation?\n",
    "-   Has job satisfaction decreased or increased as a result of remote working conditions?\n",
    "-   Which factors contribute the most to employees’ overall satisfaction with remote work?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Related Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss the main academic studies, methods, and resources that guided our analysis of remote work and well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain literature**\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of studies have looked at how remote work affects people’s productivity, well-being, and social life, which helps us understand the context of our own project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a systematic review by Oakman et al. (2022) showed that working from home can improve productivity and work–life balance, but it can also lead to more isolation, communication problems, and mental stress. These points match the variables we analyze in our dataset, such as job satisfaction, social connection, and communication quality. Another study by Correia et al. (2024) investigated how research on remote workers has evolved over the years. They found that psychological factors like loneliness, emotional pressure, and reduced social interaction are becoming increasingly important in academic discussions. This supports our decision to focus mainly on the social and psychological side of remote work instead of technical aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a well-known experiment by Bloom et al. (2013) showed that remote work can significantly improve productivity when employees have clear structures and good communication with their team. This connects directly to our analysis, since we also look at collaboration, communication, and satisfaction using the Remote Working Survey (2020). Overall, these studies confirm that the social, psychological, and performance-related impacts of remote work are important topics to explore, and they strongly support the research questions we chose for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological references**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, we used a few common data-science methods that are usually applied in survey analysis. We started with simple descriptive statistics to get a first idea of the patterns in the data, things like averages, proportions, and basic comparisons between groups. We also looked at correlations to see how different variables are related, for example whether good communication or social well-being is linked to higher productivity. Since many of our questions were answered with text options (like “strongly agree”), we converted these answers into numbers using standard Likert-scale coding so that we could analyze them properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the technical side, we followed the Python methods shown in Azizi (2025), which helped us clean the data and structure our exploratory analysis in Google Colab. We mainly used pandas for organizing and transforming the dataset (following McKinney, 2022), and matplotlib/seaborn to create the visualizations with the help of VanderPlas, 2016. These tools and references guided our process and helped us follow good data-science practices while analyzing the Remote Working Survey (2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Course material**\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of our project is inspired by the material used in class, especially the DSAS notes from Azizi (2025). These resources helped us understand how to organize our data analysis, clean our dataset, and apply basic Python techniques in Google Colab. With that said, we used the same approach shown in the course for tasks like loading data, creating new variables, handling missing values, and running exploratory data analysis. The examples provided in the course made it easier for us to use tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn in a consistent way throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical resources**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the technical side, we mainly relied on a few well-known Python resources to help us structure and run our analysis. McKinney’s book (2022) guided us with all the pandas-related tasks, such as cleaning the dataset, creating new variables, and handling missing values. We also used matplotlib and seaborn to create readable plots for our visualizations by following VanderPlas's (2016) explanations.\n",

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the 2020 Remote Working Survey, part of the NSW Remote Working Survey series, publicly available through the New South Wales Government’s Open Data Portal. “Data source: [Remote working survey 2020](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset/nsw-remote-working-survey)” The 2020 survey was conducted during August and September 2020 and aimed to understand workers experiences and attitudes toward remote and hybrid working following the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to study the impact of remote work on professional and personal well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be eligible, respondents had to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   be employed NSW residents\n",
    "\n",
    "-   have experience of remote working in their current job. After excluding unemployed individuals and those whose occupations cannot be performed remotely (dentists, cashiers, cleaners), the sample represents approximately 59% of NSW workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is the 2020 wave of the survey. A second wave was collected in March and April 2021. For the present analysis, only the 2020 dataset is being processed and explored. Once the analysis of this wave is finalized, it will be possible to extend the project by including and comparing the 2021 dataset to identify how remote work patterns evolved over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The cleaned 2020 NSW Remote Working Survey dataset contains four main types of variables: categorical, ordinal, numeric, and binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The categorical variables describe qualitative characteristics of respondents and their employment context, such as Industry, Job_type, Organisation_Size, Household, and Years_in_job. These variables are stored as text and provide context for grouping and comparison across sectors or demographic profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The ordinal variables represent ordered responses on Likert scales, reflecting opinions and perceptions about remote working. Variables such as Org_encouraged_remote_last_year, Collaboration_remote_last_year, Org_encouraged_remote_3_months, and Collaboration_remote_3_months are encoded numerically from 1 (“Strongly disagree”) to 5 (“Strongly agree”), allowing for quantitative analysis of attitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The numeric variables capture measurable quantities including time allocation, remote work proportions, and productivity. Examples include Age, Remote_pct_last_year, Preferred_remote_last_year, Productivity_remote_vs_workplace, and several variables representing hours spent on commuting, working, and personal or domestic activities. These are stored as integers or floats, making them suitable for descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The binary variables (Gender, Managing_position) indicate Male/Femal or Yes/No conditions, encoded as 0 and 1. These variables enable comparisons between distinct groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also contains several important pieces of metadata that ensure its quality and usability for analysis. Each observation is identified by a unique respondent code (Response_ID), which guarantees traceability and prevents duplication during data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, all variable names were standardized to concise, descriptive identifiers (Org_encouraged_remote_last_year) to make the variables easier to read, reuse, and analyze in statistical software. This naming convention makes the analysis process simpler and clearer throughout the project.\n",

    "\n",
    "Following best practices, the file is loaded using a relative path via project_root, ensuring that the document remains fully reproducible regardless of the execution location. Because the original file contained specific typographic characters that caused decoding issues during import, the dataset is read using the latin-1 encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the file, several checks were performed to confirm correct import: verification of the dataset dimensions, inspection of column names and data types (df.info()), preview of the first rows to ensure values were properly formatted. These steps guarantee that the dataset is correctly imported and ready for subsequent exploratory analysis."

    "The variables describing the percentage of time spent or preferred working remotely, the original responses (“Less than 10% of my time”…“100% - All of my time”). These were first converted into numeric percentage values using a mapping dictionary. All four percentage-related variables were processed in the same way. Before applying the mapping, non-breaking spaces () and extra whitespace were removed from the strings to avoid parsing issues. After the text values were mapped to numeric percentages (“80%” → 80), the values were converted into proportions between 0 and 1 by dividing by 100.\n",

    "The variable Productivity_remote_vs_workplace, the survey responses (I’m 20% more productive when I work remotely” or “I’m 10% less productive”). These text responses were converted into clean numeric values using a custom parsing function. The mapping works as follows: Statements indicating more productive remotely return a positive percentage (“20% more productive” → +20). Statements indicating less productive remotely return a negative percentage (“10% less productive” → –10). Statements indicating no difference return 0. This transformation results in a numeric scale where positive values mean higher productivity when working remotely, negative values reflect lower productivity, and zero indicates no change. This allows the variable to be analysed quantitatively, averaged across groups, or used in visualisations."

    "### Spotting Mistakes and Missing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before conducting the analysis, the dataset was reviewed to identify missing values, inconsistencies, and unusually small categories. This ensures that only reliable and interpretable data are used in the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identified missing data**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Most variables contained very few missing values, mainly in attitudinal questions where some respondents simply did not answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Additional missingness appeared when converting textual inputs (percentages or productivity statements) into numeric formats, entries that could not be parsed were intentionally converted to NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The inspection of category sizes showed that some groups were extremely small, such as the “Rather not say” gender category (2 respondents), which was removed because it cannot support meaningful analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach to handling missing data**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Deletion was applied when missingness or category size was extremely small and analytically useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Imputation with a neutral value (3 = Neither agree nor disagree) was used for missing Likert-scale answers to preserve observations without creating bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Conversion to numeric with errors=“coerce” was used for percentage and productivity variables, producing valid NaN values when entries could not be interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because missingness was limited and mostly isolated to subjective questions, more complex methods were not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future handling of small or irrelevant categories**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   If additional categories, during the analysis progress, are found to be too small to contribute meaningfully, they will be removed, flagged, or when conceptually appropriate grouped together with similar categories to preserve statistical power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future variable selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Some variables will ultimately explain the effects of remote work on health, productivity, or work life balance better than others. Variables that show no meaningful correlation or explanatory power in later stages of the project will also be removed to keep the analysis focused, interpretable, and relevant.\n",

    "### Listing Anomalies and Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed inspection of the numeric variables, using both summary statistics and histogram visualisations, revealed several anomalies and potential outliers in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detected anomalies**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Age variable: Two respondents appear with an age of 120 years, which is biologically impossible and indicates a clear data entry error. This type of anomaly commonly occurs when the birth year is mistyped—for example, entering 1900 instead of 2000, or 2005 instead of 1920—which produces unrealistic age values. These observations will therefore be removed, while other extreme but plausible ages (such as 75 or 83) are retained at this stage. The minimum value (19) is plausible for entry-level workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Domestic_hours_workplace: A single observation of –1 hour is impossible and indicates a recording error.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Working and commuting time variables: Extremely high records were observed, such as 23 hours of work in a day or 10–12 hours of commuting.\n",
    "\n",
    "While unlikely, these may represent exceptional cases (long-distance travel, extended shifts). They are retained unless later analysis shows they distort results.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Commute_hours_remote: Values up to 12 hours on remote days are implausible and likely due to misinterpretation or input mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Productivity variable: Extreme values (+50%, –50%) appear in the data but remain plausible since the question explicitly asked respondents to report percentage differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach to handling outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Outliers were evaluated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Visual inspection (histograms from univariate EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Summary statistics (min/max, interquartile ranges)\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Domain knowledge (negative hours, impossible ages)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Following best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Impossible values (age = 120, domestic hours = –1) will be removed before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Extreme but plausible behaviours (very long workdays) are kept unless they later bias model results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Additional outliers identified during the analysis phase may be removed, flagged, or grouped depending on their relevance and impact.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why reference figures?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automatic numbering (updates if you reorder)\n",
    "2. Clickable links in HTML output\n",
    "3. Professional academic writing standard\n",
    "4. Helps readers find the relevant visualization\n",

    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember: Interpretation is more important than the plots themselves!** Each finding below not only states *what* we observe but also *why* it matters and *what* it means for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarize the main insights from your exploratory analysis. **Always reference your figures when discussing findings and provide thorough interpretation!**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Distribution patterns**: The performance scores shown in @fig-performance-dist follow an approximately normal distribution with a mean of `{python} f'{dummy_performance[\"performance\"].mean():.2f}'` and standard deviation of `{python} f'{dummy_performance[\"performance\"].std():.2f}'`. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Interpretation**: This normal distribution suggests that most students perform around the average, with fewer students at the extremes (very high or very low scores). The relatively small standard deviation indicates consistent performance across the group. This pattern is typical in educational settings and suggests that the assessment was well-calibrated meaning not too easy (which would cause ceiling effects) nor too difficult (which would cause floor effects). The normality assumption also validates the use of parametric statistical tests for subsequent analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outliers and data quality**: The box plot (@fig-performance-box) reveals minimal outliers, with only a few observations falling below the lower whisker.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Interpretation**: The scarcity of outliers suggests good data quality and consistent measurement. The few low-performing outliers warrant further investigation - they could represent students who faced unusual circumstances or measurement errors. However, their small number means they are unlikely to significantly impact our overall conclusions. This finding gives us confidence in proceeding with the full dataset without extensive outlier removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Group differences**: @fig-performance-by-instructor demonstrates noticeable variation in performance across different instructors, with some instructors showing higher median scores than others. The ANOVA test (@tbl-anova-test) confirms these differences are `{python} 'statistically significant (p < 0.05)' if p_value < 0.05 else 'not statistically significant (p ≥ 0.05)'`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Interpretation**: `{python} 'The significant differences across instructors raise important questions about teaching effectiveness, grading consistency, or student assignment to sections. This finding suggests that \"instructor\" should be included as a control variable in any regression models predicting performance.' if p_value < 0.05 else 'The lack of significant differences suggests that instructor assignment does not substantially impact performance, or that grading standards are well-harmonized across sections.'` It also indicates that comparing students across different sections requires careful consideration. From a policy perspective, this might warrant investigating whether certain teaching methods are more effective or whether grading standards need to be harmonized across sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Relationships**: The correlation matrix (@fig-correlation-matrix) reveals several interesting patterns:\n",
    "   - Strong positive correlation (r = `{python} f'{corr_matrix.loc[\"Experience\", \"Salary\"]:.2f}'`) between Experience and Salary\n",
    "   - Moderate positive correlation (r = `{python} f'{corr_matrix.loc[\"Experience\", \"Performance\"]:.2f}'`) between Experience and Performance\n",
    "   - Weak correlation (r = `{python} f'{corr_matrix.loc[\"Age\", \"Performance\"]:.2f}'`) between Age and Performance\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Interpretation**: The Experience-Salary correlation aligns with economic theory that experience is rewarded in labor markets. The Experience-Performance correlation suggests that experience contributes to better performance, though other factors clearly matter as well. Interestingly, Age shows minimal correlation with Performance, suggesting that chronological age alone doesn't predict success - what matters is relevant experience. These patterns will guide our variable selection for predictive modeling, favoring Experience over Age as a key predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Experience-Performance relationship**: @fig-scatter-experience-performance clearly shows a positive linear relationship, with more experienced individuals tending to have higher performance scores. The correlation coefficient is `{python} f'{corr:.2f}'`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Interpretation**: The linear relationship visible in the scatter plot confirms that experience has a consistent, positive effect on performance. However, the substantial scatter around the regression line indicates that experience alone doesn't determine performance - individual differences and other factors play important roles. This suggests that while experience is valuable, organizations shouldn't rely solely on it when making hiring or promotion decisions.\n",

    "## Common Mistakes in Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation (not interpretation):** \"The histogram shows a normal distribution.\"  \n",
    "**Why it's insufficient:** This only describes what you see - it's an observation, not an interpretation. You need to explain what it *means* and *why it matters*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Good interpretation (observation + story):** \"The histogram shows a normal distribution (mean = 0.90, sd = 0.05), which indicates consistent performance across students. This pattern validates the use of parametric statistical tests in our subsequent analysis. The tight distribution suggests the assessment was well-calibrated, effectively distinguishing between ability levels without ceiling or floor effects that would compress scores.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "After showing model results, you **must interpret them**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Poisson regression model identifies three significant predictors of insurance claim frequency. Vehicle age shows a positive coefficient (β = 0.08, p < 0.01), indicating that each additional year of vehicle age increases expected claims by approximately 8%. Driver age has a negative coefficient (β = -0.02, p < 0.001), meaning older drivers file fewer claims. The urban location dummy variable (β = 0.15, p < 0.05) suggests urban drivers have 15% higher claim rates than rural drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model's pseudo-R² of 0.22 indicates that these predictors explain only 22% of claim variation. Unobserved factors like driving behavior, road conditions, and individual risk tolerance likely account for the remaining variation. This suggests that while demographic variables are useful for pricing, insurers should not rely solely on them for risk assessment.\"\n",

    "**Good**: \"This project investigated the relationship between customer demographics and insurance claim frequencies using a dataset of 5,000 policyholders. Our exploratory analysis revealed that age and vehicle type were the strongest predictors of claim frequency, with older drivers (60+) filing 40% fewer claims than younger drivers (under 25). Logistic regression analysis identified three key risk factors: driver age, vehicle age, and urban vs rural location. These findings suggest that current pricing models may underweight geographic factors. For insurance practitioners, this implies that incorporating more granular location data could improve risk segmentation and reduce adverse selection.\"\n",
